# Ninty Launcher - Database

Title database for https://github.com/ninstar/Ninty-Launcher.

**Pull requests** are welcome, but before doing so, read the section below.

## How to

All entries are stored in the [database.ini](https://github.com/ninstar/NL-TitleDB/blob/main/database.ini), every entry needs an icon associated with its index in its filename (icons are stored in [icons/](https://github.com/ninstar/NL-TitleDB/tree/main/icons)).

An entry example:
```ini
; {EntryType}

[EntryIndex]
title="The Game DX"
tagA="The_Game_DX.exe"
tagB="\The Game DX"
tagC="\The Game DX\Game.exe"
```

**Requirements**
- **Icons need to be in .png** format and in ``1:1``  aspect ratio (i.e. a square), the minimum size is ``256x256``.
- **Titles can only be 32 characters long**.
- You can have up to 6 tags fo each entry: ***A, B, C, D, E, F***.
- **Tags can never be the same**, regardless of their entry index.
- If the name of the executable is too ambiguous or generic (something like ``game.exe``), use the ``\``, Ninty will take into account **the name of the folder** to avoid tag conflicts. 
- Optionally you can put a ``forward=1`` or ``shortcut=1`` to make Ninty set the application type to one of these two automatically.
- The ``{EntryType}`` field must be **one of those listed bellow**, choose the one that best fits your entry.
	- ``{G}`` **Games** - The title says by itself.
	- ``{M}`` **Mods** - Mods and loaders for official and unofficial games.
	- ``{A}`` **Applications** - Focused on general users: applications for general purpose, multimedia, etc...
	- ``{T}`` **Tools** - Focused on advanced users: tools for software development, game modding creation, etc...
	- ``{E}`` **Emulators** - Exclusively for video game emulators.
